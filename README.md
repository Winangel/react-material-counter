# react-material-counter
A side project to learn react, redux, react-native, relay and graphQL! 

How fun is it going to be ?

So far I managed to create a client webapp with redux and react, and an express-server with mongoose and graphql to serve the
data to the client.

Next step is to link the server with the client using another FB technology : Relay...

TODO :

* Write a readme
* Create a graphQL server
* Link client to server with Relay
* Create a react-native iOS application
* Create a react-native android application
